# Word-Guess-Game

9/16 -- Figued out how to populate underscores. Still need to figure out what the logic looks like behind a user guess. Was able to repurpose some RPS code for the onkey event but I need to figure out how to dynamically update the underscoreWord to show the userGuess. I'm thinking the initial for loop needs to show up again but somehow change it to show the userGuess.
